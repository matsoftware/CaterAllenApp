# CaterAllenApp

Unofficial iOS banking app for CaterAllen customers

## Why?

[CaterAllen](https://www.caterallen.co.uk/personal-banking) offers a banking service to small businesses in Uk through Santander's branches and its website, but it's not currently offering an official mobile app (as per today, september 2018).

## Who can use it?

Any developer with a valid Apple Developer Account can clone the repository and install the app on his own device after changing the bundle identifier.

## How does it work?

This app will let you automatically login to your default account by simply automating the login steps performed on the website by interacting with the embedded `WKWebView` through javascript commands.
It offers keychain storage for your personal details and authentication through passcode / TouchID / FaceID.
